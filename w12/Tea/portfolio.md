# Your Personal Portfolio Site

### Designing it

* Think about who you want to view your site (potential employers, freelance opportunities, friends). I know it is tempting to make it flashy with tons of jQuery plugins, but the most important thing when designing your site is to make it EASY for your visitors to access the information they want and navigate around the page.

* Think about the goal for your site and what you want your users to do (read about your story, look at your work / code, contact you). Guide them to taking those actions by making them prominent / easy to find.

* Wireframe what you want your site to look like first!

### Building it

* Services like WordPress.com, SquareSpace, etc. are great and useful to use (even for developers)! That being said, use this opportunity to show that you can make a website, since that's what you want to be hired to do...

* Use the right tool for the job. It is probably overkill to build a Rails app for your portfolio site (though Sinatra might make sense if you want a simple persistent interface to ActiveRecord...). In most casese, a simple HTML, CSS & JavaScript page should do the trick. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) works really well for this.

* Use proper indentation and organize your code. Chances are people will view your source!
