WOAH
====

woah is a simple classroom tool to keep a real time tally of subjects and concepts that students are having a hard time grasping.  it facilitates the teacher reviewing subjects, supports annonymous questioning/flagging, and allows students an opportunity to help their peers grapple with new concepts.

###Pros
* websockets are cool
* useable application
we can get feedback from "target users", internally and externally
a strong expertise area to showcase for interviews
cool javascript but is also fairly straightforward
easy way to model it in your mind - its basically an advanced todo list

###Cons
* websockets are hard
* the UI for the students and the teachers is very different
* potentially complicated interface between teachers/students/and items
  (but good opportunity to use AGILE/MVP strategy to mitigate)
