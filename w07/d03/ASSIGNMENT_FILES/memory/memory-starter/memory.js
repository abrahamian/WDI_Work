// This is one way you could approach this. 
// This is more of a functional approach than an object-oriented one, but it works well in this scenario.
// If you don't like this approach feel free to throw this code out and write your own :)

//Code In Here gets executed once code is ready. This is like window.onload.
$(function() {

//array of letters in the game
var letters = ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'E' ];

//Id of the last card you clicked on.
var lastCardId = ''

// Code that runs to set up the game
function startGame() {

//Code that runs when you click on a card
function cardClick() {

}

//Add hoverclass to cards.
function hovering() {

//Start the timer
function startTime() {

//Increment the timer and display the new time
