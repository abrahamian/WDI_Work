# Week 7: JavaScript, jQuery & AJAX

###What did we do last week?
We started learning a new programming language, JavaScript. We learned the basics of the language and some of its quirks. Along the way, we built a utility very similar to underscore.js to help us with common tasks. Toward the end of the week, we learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and respond to events to make our websites interactive.
