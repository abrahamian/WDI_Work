To help clarify and cement into place the JavaScript concepts that we learned last week, today we'll be working on a To Do Application. 

####Key concepts you will need to apply today:

* [Create objects in JavaScript.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#creating_new_objects)  (Know how to do it using an object initializer AND using a constructor). [Objects Example from class](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Array_Work/blob/master/w06/d02/Instructor/js/objects.js)
* [Create and manipulate HTML Elements and append them to the DOM.](http://christianheilmann.com/stuff/JavaScript-DOM-Cheatsheet.pdf) (Check out Ghoulify and LOTR for help with this)
* Use window.onload to run JavaScript after the DOM has loaded.
* [Write JavaScript that responds to events using listeners.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener) (ATM & TicTacToe are good examples of this)

## User Stories

To help stay focused and organized, use user stories to guide how you work through this assignment. Here are the ones that I came up with:

* As a user, I want to be able to enter a To Do item and add it on my To Do List
* As a user, I want to be able to delete an item from my ToDo List
* As a user, I want to be able to move a To Do item to my completed tasks list
* As a user, I want to be able to delete an item from my completed tasks list
* As a user, I want to validate my to do items to make sure i don't accidentally enter a blank item
* As a user, I want to be able to create To Do items by pressing "enter" on my keyboard so I don't have to click the button every time

####Bonus:

* As a user, I want to be able to see what date a To Do item was created on
* As a user, I want to be able to see what date a Completed To Do item was completed on


## Other tips and things to consider:
* Play with the working version and inspect it. That should help you see what DOM elements are created for each To Do Item
* How can we design this in an object oriented way / How might we model our objects?
* As you implement each user story, look back at the code you wrote. Is there a way to refactor it to make it DRYer or more clear?
