Selects Tributes
  2 tributes per district at random
    1 M & 1 F



    HW: 
    tests & code for user stories concerning the reaping and getting sponsers and ratings


As gamemaker, I want to select 1 M & 1 F from each district to be a tribute so we have contestants for the game
  -male and female must be between 12 - 18

As gamemaker, I want to assign each tribute sponsors & skills so they have varying chances towards survival to make the game more interesting.
