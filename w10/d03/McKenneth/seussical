1. # Regexp and Ham

Using the built in method (`save_as filename, contents`) and string (`txt`) provided in `regexp.rb`, write regular expressions to perform the following requests...

1. Count all instances where Sam is not referred to as "Sam-I-Am."

sam[^-]/i --> text.scan(/sam[^-]/i).count

6

2. Change all instances of Sam-I-Am to "Sammy Jam."

where a is the instances of Sam-I-Am

a.map {|x| x.gsub(/-i-am/i, "mmy Jam")}

3. List all the places and animals whom Sam refuses to eat with (the bigot).

text.scan(a\s\w{2,5}[^\W])

4. Create a new file where the narrator constantly agrees to eat (ie, remove the nots).

text.gsub(/not\s/i, "")

5. Create a new file where "Sam" is "PJ," and is referred to as "PJ-I-Say", and the narrator is being forced to eat "curds and whey."

text.gsub(/green\seggs\sand\sham/i, "curds and whey").gsub(/sam/i, "PJ")

6. List all of the sentences that are repeated twice in a row. This way you can prove to the narrator that he has a problem and should see a doctor before his dimensia gets worse.
