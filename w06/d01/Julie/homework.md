* Store the exchange rate in a variable

##### Converting dollars to pounds:

* Store a dollar amount into a variable.
* Convert it to pounds and output "$NN is £NN".

##### Converting pounds to dollars:

* Convert it to dollar and output "£NN is $NN."

##### Cleaning it up:

* Can you make sure the output is only 2 decimal places?

##### Refactoring

* Can you refactor the code so that it uses functions? Write a function dollarsToPounds that takes a dollar number as input and outputs a string of what the pound equivalent is.
* Do the same for poundsToDollars
