always start with

-border: width type color;
  border-width: width;

-border-radius: rad;

-background-img:   ;

-backgraound-color: color;

-padding: w w w w;    (w = width)

-margin: w w w w;

-overflow: w w w w;

-width: number;
-height: number;

-margin: width auto:

-display

-text-align: element; 

-float  when you give something a float it pulls out of the contained content and renders them accoriding to thier own set of rules. so instead it 
dont use float unless you really understand how it works,    

use to align    but applies to children NOT SELF 



3 types of display: block, inline(txt), inline-block which = a block that fits in line
inline goes left to right gets to end of line and goes down.

margin width auto computes the parent boxes content width, subtracts them and divides them for you.

width is th width of the screen height is stretchy.
the way we center boxes is by messing around with the margins.

the realm outside the border is the margin

web pages by default have overflow set to ato OFF so it will not overflow off the page?


*top right bottom left

SPECIFICITY
id beats .class beats element 

current element beats something applied to the ancestor element

combination selectors(more data in selector)ex div.container will beat out .container

last defined style wins

look at the screenshot.png which is how the desgner wants it to look.
then you do html skeleton:


HTML
head

body (check for top level elements):
the logo -> img 

(can put it in a div or make it a background.) but we are using div because 
its not great practice to style the body b/c when you start using JS if you want to do it to ebrything
you want to use body but if body is doing desingn stff it can get problematic.) 

<div class = :body-wrapper>
children go in here
</div>

div.body-wrapper 
div.box: 

 h2 .card-header
 img.card-image

 p.card-text
   a.
