borders are good to see the realtionships elements have with each other

border= width,type,color || or can do them seperately 

border-radius of 5px is the same as a perfectly rounded circle

horziantally overflow is set to off and it spans the entire width by default

margin with auto computes the width of the containing parents box and its own width and divdes in order to center its self
