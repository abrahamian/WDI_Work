Sinatra Conventions

sinatra counts the number of slashes
if its not a symbol it tries to match otherwise it automatically matches it if it has a symbol

what ever data has been sent

ERB files use the file_name.erb live in the directory /views and are referenced with erb(:name_of_file)

ERB = Embbed Ruby

get "/x/y/:z" do
  "String"
end

http: 
protocol

example.com = domain name

/path/next/ = path

pj.html = file type

?=google+this = query string

old_style = path:directory structure of the server everything is a GET, except form submission(POST)
the way you used to info with a 

Get is you put it in query string
Post:input tags(hidden)

new_style = (REST) path is semantic with the new style you can use the HTTP VERBS!


                          SQL
POST = Create   Insert
GET = Read       Select
PUT = Update    Update
Delete = Delete Delete

<tags hold meta data>
tags have open and close & attributes

the idea behind XHTML was to make html a stricter language
 meta charset = "utf-8" is very important
