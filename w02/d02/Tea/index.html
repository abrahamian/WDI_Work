        <p>Remy leRouge was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. When he was 10 (dog) years old, he ran away from the orphanage where he was raised and tried to make a life as a journalist in the big city. He was rejected when editors discovered he was a dog, so he resorted to a life of pick pocketing and performing tricks for food. He stole from a drug-lord one day and was forced to pay off his debt by becoming a drug mule, transporting large quantities of narcotics between borders in the American South. Remy eventually outed his captors in a Pulitzer-winning article he published under a pseudonym; the article led to the arrests of the leaders in the drug ring. Today, he has gone over extreme makeovers and is modeling. His youthful appearance juxtaposed by his soulful eyes has led him to become the most sought-after dog model in American Vogue. He is no longer doing runway work.</p>
