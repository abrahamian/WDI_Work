	<!-- some words -->
	<p>Bryce Harper is a beast. He is only 20 years old, and is already setting batting records in the Major Leagues. He is a two-time All-Star; he was runner up in the Home Dun Derby this year; he has hit more home runs than any player <em>EVER</em> before turning 21; he hustles harder than anyone else on the field -- his fire is contagious.</p>
