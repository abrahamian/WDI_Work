#Sinatra Routing App with HTML & CSS

####Objectives:
- Practice routing, passing parameters, and ERB Templates
- Style a website with basic HTML & CSS

#### Prompt
- You are going to recreate your own version (or something similar) of the [pair programming bot](http://pairprogrammingbot.com/) from scratch using Sinatra. The web app should follow a flowchart. Each page will either have a Yes/No option or Done option which links to another page.

####Options (Choose one)

- Implement a web version of the [engineering flowchart](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8160/7214525854_733237dd83_z.jpg)

- Implement a web version of the [pair programming bot](http://pairprogrammingbot.com/). Ignore the stuff on that site about "Inspiration" & "run tests".

- If you are feeling pretty good about rendering templates, try choosing your own fun flowchart instead. Someone made a whole pinterest board of them [here](http://www.pinterest.com/therealvisually/fun-flowcharts/)

#### Planning
- Map out your program first. ie BEFORE you start coding. It will be helpful to draw a flow chart.

- You should use ERB templates to keep your code DRY. What types of pages will you need a template for?

- For each of the templates that you are going to use, what information do you need to pass in using an instance variable?

- How many / which pages do you need? What template type is each page going to be?

#### Implement it
- Code it up and show your friends!
- Include a CSS file
- Bonus: Make your site look nice. Add some images.

#### Hints
- All of your routes for today's assignment should be using a GET request.
- Your HTML files should be VERY SHORT
