Ruby Redux
Classes
  definitions that describe objects and hold methods for interactif w/that data

  describe how interface interact w/obj
  @instance vars
  local vars
  self

Objects

containers that exist on the computer
hold data and hold methods for interactif w/that data

you need a name to talk to the object
the name is the pointer or refernce ie a var.

in pry try 
x = Array.new
y = Array.new
so if you write 
y <<  22 
this says go to y and put in 22
then type x and then y and you will see y has 22

1. assignment or refersntial confusion
  -a variable name means nothing

2. class vs object confusion

3. def confusion(methods)
    *defining vs calling

everything in ruby in an object 
   -except for def (they describe the object)
   -blocks (they are just stmts of code)
  -methods are not an object its how you interact with an    
   object1

that means everything has a class

            2.class == a Fixnum class


METHODS

are a block of statements ieprocedures that takes some number (0 or more) objects as input is CALLED on an object and returns an object.

def = given these inputs 2+2 the outputs will = something
