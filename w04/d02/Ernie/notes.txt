Libary = gems
You call it (pry,active_recored)

Ruby is the bricks, Rails is the house, and we furnish it as programmers

Framework = gems 
It calls you
collection of libarays (sinatra)

get '/'do
(our code)
end

when someone makes a get request sinarta call your code
Thats when the say a rails app,sinatra app etc....

Framworks evolve to slove common problems they do the work that doesnt change between App to App

scales good in turns of volumes but scales really well in term of teams

frameworks often embed best practices (MVC,REST,Security)

Convention over Configuartion
