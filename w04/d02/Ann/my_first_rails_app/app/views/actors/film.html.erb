<h1>Cleopatra</h1>
<p>In all of cinema history, Cleopatra is one of the most expensive films ever made (adjusted for inflation). It received mixed reviews from critics, although critics and audiences alike generally praised Taylor and Burton's performances. It was the highest grossing film of 1963, earning US $26 million ($57.7 million total), yet made a loss due to its cost of $44 million, making it the only film ever to be the highest grossing film of the year yet to run at a loss;[4] for this, the film has been considered a moderate (but not total) box office failure. The film later won four Academy Awards, and was nominated for five more, including Best Picture (ultimately losing to Tom Jones).</p>
