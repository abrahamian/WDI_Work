Create a project_brainstorm.md file with a few sentences describing a first draft of your idea(s)

--What problem are you trying to solve?

Poorly planned group events
	-people volunteering for tasks and not completing them
	-poor services chosen due to overwhelmed organizers picking up the slack of multiple others (possible crowd sourcing the event planning process)

prevent fraud
	-prevent organizers from over charging attendies
	-prevent organizers from providing lesser services than expected
	-monitor flow of money along with balance sheet / receipts 


--What will your app do / what features will it have?

Will allow a group of people to plan an event, such as a reunion, in a transparent manner.  All attendees of the even will be able to see quotes for services, who is working on a given task, how much money is collected, and where it is being spent.  Oranizers can receive notifications and reminders on task (their own and others').
	-task tracking
	-quote tracking
	-expense tracking
	-money collection tracking
	-attendee listing
	-(expected) cost per attendee tracking
	-attendee discussion and voting on services/packages
	-availability of related services


--What do you think you can reasonably implement in 1 week?

Basic tracking of attendies, organizers, quotes, expenses, and money collected.


--What APIs or other resources might you use / do you plan on using?

None of first iteration.  Long term payment services/paypal, Yelp/review services, Google maps.
