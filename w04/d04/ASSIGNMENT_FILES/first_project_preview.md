# FIRST PROJECT PREVIEW

Here is a preview of the requirements for your first project. Your assignment tonight will be to take them into consideration and brainstorm what you might want to work on next week.

Tip: Work on something you ***like***

## Prompt

Create a `project_brainstorm.md` file with a few sentences describing a first draft of your idea(s)

* What problem are you trying to solve?
* What will your app do / what features will it have?
* What do you think you can reasonably implement in 1 week?
* What APIs or other resources might you use / do you plan on using?

You may want to spend some time tonight researching and trying access APIs or other data sources you might be interested in.

Tip: Learn about markdown syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

## Project Core Requirements

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly.
* **Views.** Use partials and view helpers to DRY up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data on the backend (controllers & models) and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify necessary model fields are populated (not blank) for required fields, valid email addresses, etc.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have a user model with basic authentication and authorization set up.
* **Styling** Make your app look nice. Think about color & typography and make sure everything is aligned properly.
* **Use an API (Optional)** APIs add data and functionality to your app (some have gems!)
