## Restaurant safety guide

> All restaurant inspection results are publicly posted
  and can be viewed within a few days of the inspection,
  but the information is presented in such generalized terms
  that it is mostly useless in determining whether a restaurant is place you actually want to eat at or whether you should give it a second thought. It's interface is also poorly designed and unintuitive. I want to make an app that would condense all of the restaurants down into 3 basic categories that would be color coded:

  * red -> DANGER
  * yellow -> CAUTION
  * green -> A-OK

> The categories to start out with will be based on the number
  of points received and the presence of certain critical violations received on the inspection. This I think I can reasonably implement in a week. There can be an account system that allows you to save restaurants you like and ones you want to avoid. Further down the line I would like to dive even deeper and base it on point totals for specific violations and judging restaurants based on the individual condition levels of the more critical violations. Also since the data is released every week it could be live updating...

> I want to use the google maps api/services to map out the restaurant locations for the individual restaurant pages, maybe add directions. Maybe the yelp search api to list a yelp review for the restaurants, if there is one. Also I have all the restaurant inspection data that I'll go over this weekend.
