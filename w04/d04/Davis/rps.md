# Morning Exercise - Rock, Paper Scissors

## Objectives
* Work on problem solving skills & planning
* Practice talking to others about your code

## Prompt
Your job is to design and build a console based Ruby program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

#### Phase 1
* The user should be prompted for their rock, paper or scissors selection
* The computer should make a random selection (rock, paper, scissors)
* The user should be told what the computer chose and if they won or lost

#### Phase 2
* How DRY is your code? If you find yourself listing every possible scenario by hand, it may be an opportunity to refactor...

#### Phase 3 (Bonus)
Expand your app for [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock). What is the most efficient way to keep track of all the scenarios?

#### Phase 4 (Bonus)
Expand your program to be "Best out of 3" (Keep playing until someone wins 2 games)

## Instructions

Work in pairs. Plan together, work on the same code, and be nice!
Get as far as you can through the phases. I will cut you off when time is up.

You MAY have to present what you did to the class. Be prepared to talk about:

* Your thought process / how you broke the problem down
* Where you landed with your code and what decisions you made
* Where you struggled / still have questions
* What you are going to tackle next

Pro Tip: PLAN FIRST
