# Project: Awesome Citi

# What problem are you trying to solve?
* During peak hours, citibike users are having a hard time finding an available dock for * their bikes at the end of their commute.


## What will your app do / what features will it have?
* The Citibike App will route users to an available citibike dock based on proximity to their destination point in real time. 
* The app will send alerts to the user's smartphone as a 'hands free' dock guide. The three types of alerts will be: The first alert will be distinct to the users' top destination dock preferences, the second alert will be distinct to their second chioce. The third alert will let the user know that neither of their top two preferences are available and the user should check in with the app to receive the nearest location to dock their bike. 


## What do you think you can reasonably implement in 1 week? 
* Ability to create a user profile.
* A database of citibike dock locations. 
* Connect data to smartphone alerts. (?)
* Seed the app with citibike usage data.
* Style
* Publish via Heroku

* **Nice to have:**

*Voice commands for alerts.
* **COMMERCE**

* Address the issue of having bikes available during rush hour.
* Feature: A user can request a bike and make a bid. 'I'm willing to pay $10 to have someone bring me a bike to x dock by x date/time.' Another user can accept the bid and carry out the task. When the task is finished, the task doer will receive the funds.
* Ability to bid for someone to dock your bike for you so you don't have to hunt for a dock.   

## What APIs or other resources might you use / do you plan on using?
* 3rd party APIs for citibike. 
* Everything I learned in class! 
* A review of existing citibike apps.
