>## The magical world of the US Senate
>Sometimes our politicians seem more like cartoon characters than the selfless cogs
>of democracy that we hope them to be. This very patriotic app would utilize an api 
>released by the sunlight foundation (http://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) and do the following:

*   Find users' senator using zipcode.

*   A method then evaluates based on a sampling of legislative action what disney character they are 
    most like. For example, a vote for S. 1238 (A bill that would set student loan
    interest rates to lower levels) would set that person on track to be Robin Hood. This process would be very scientific.  

*   Show user a picture of their disney senator, a few of their votes, and their contact information.





>## My State Rocks
>State pride, mixed with music.

* User enters state.

* search through lyrics db for matches to the state name.

* Have a state pride youtube party.
