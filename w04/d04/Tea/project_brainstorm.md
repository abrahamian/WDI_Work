# PROJECT BRAINSTORMING with Tea!

* **What problem are you trying to solve?**

	* Grocery shopping planning in conjunction with weekly meal planning (I am a terrible cook). 

* **What will your app do / what features will it have?**
	* I have multiple app ideas; each solve one of those problems. 
	* One app allows users to pick dishes that sound good to them. After choosing 2 or 3 dishes, it not only gives you recipe/ingredient list, but suggests other dishes with similar ingredients so that you can make a whole week's worth of meals based on similar ingredients. The app is targeted towards those who aren't used to having to plan their own weekly meals. The app will also give users a list of ingredients to purchase.

* **What do you think you can reasonably implement in 1 week?**
	* suggestions for dishes with similar ingredient lists, based on a user selection of 2 or 3 dishes. 
	* list of shared ingredients as a grocery list.
	* user sign up/login.

* **What APIs or other resources might you use / do you plan on using?**
	* Food to Fork

	* Yummly Recipe API
		* https://developer.yummly.com/
	* Facebook login? Twitter login?
