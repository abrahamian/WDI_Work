Markdown:  Commuter Trivia

I will build a trivia game application.
  I will have a user signup with email
  the user wil have to sign in and the app will authenticate the user.  emails will have to be unique

  Commuter Trivia - a Web app that will:


   * Log In a user
   *
      * Using one of the following:
      *
         * email
         * Facebook and/or Twitter
   * Have a welcome screen with game choices
   *
      * game choice will be base on:
      *
         *  # of questions
         * possibly location (using google maps)
         * possibly a subject (i.e. sports, current events, etc.) - [see first iteration below]
   * The game will pull from a trivia API
   *
      * Possibilities
      *
         * List of Trivia API's (to come)
      * For this first iteration the questions will likely be random
   * Other functionality will include:
   *
      * keep track of users and their scores
      * keep score for the current session
      * a timer for each question
      * post high scorers
