# FIRST PROJECT DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together. You will be working **individually** for this project. Show us what you've got!

Tip: Work on something you ***like***

## OBJECTIVES

* Build your own Rails application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly!
* **Views.** Use partials and view helpers to DRY up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data on the backend (controllers & models) and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify necessary model fields are populated (not blank) for required fields, valid email addresses, etc.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have a user model with basic authentication and authorization set up.
* **Styling** Make your app look nice. Think about color & typography and make sure everything is aligned properly.
* **Use an API (Optional)** APIs add data and functionality to your app (some have gems!)


## COMPLETED PROJECT DELIVERABLES

Submit the following at the bottom of your `project_log.md` file via pull request in your week 5 folder:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub
  * NOTE: Your source code on Github should have a `README.md` that is a summary of the project. Talk about the how and why of the project. What problem are you solving? How was it built? What tech did you use? What problems did you have along the way? What do you want to work on next?

## YOUR CODE

* Naming. Make sure your variable and method names are semantic and would make sense to someone else who is unfamiliar with your code.
* Well-formatted. Indent properly, format consistently.
* Code in the proper places. Any business logic in views?
* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your controllers, models, etc?
* Adheres to the code formatting styles we've been presenting in class. [Github Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)

## WE WANT TO SEE

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your resourcefulness, ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

## WHAT WE WON'T HELP YOU WITH

* Anything related to JavaScript
* CSS Frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation
* API's that you can't 'ping' and interact with by Monday
