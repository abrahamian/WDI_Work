## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

You should include the following in a `README.md` file.

* **Scope.** A few sentences describing your app. What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?

* **User Stories.** Write user stories for the features you plan to implement. Chances are you won't be able to implement everything you could possibly want in one week, so it's important to prioritize these. Put these in the order you plan to implement them in your `README.md` file.

* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations (ERD diagram) for your project.  Pen and paper is very easy and you can take a picture to save it, or use software like Gliffy (online). You can include this in your folder as an image.

* **Resources.** Gather the necessary resources and bookmark links to any documentation, references, APIs, gems, etc. you will be using in your project.  Add them to your `README.md` file in a section called "Resources." Make sure you actually practice pinging any APIs you plan to use to make sure they will work.

* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Omnigraffle or Balsamic. You can include these in your folder as images.
