#Students & Teachers

Super quick warmup on JavaScript Objects

### Using the constructor method, define a Student
- He/she has a name
- He/she has a list of skills
- He/she can learn a new skill
- He/she can forget (remove the last oldest they learned)
    
### Using object literal notation, define a `feeney` object
- He has a name
- He has students
- He can add students to his list of students
- He can teach a skill to his students

### Bonus
- A student can "zone out". If they are zoned out and a teacher tries to to them something, they don't learn it.
- Ensure that for a given student, their skills are unique (ie no duplicates)
