# Weekend Homework


### Watchio

1. Get to MVP (original user stories)
2. [Review / Annotate Jeff's code](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Array_Work/tree/master/w11/d05/Instructor/Watchio)

Bonus:

* A User can click a search result to see a trailer
* A User can't add a movie from search results that's already in their watch list (ie, it's viewable, but "grayed out" or something...)

### Final Project

1. Begin to outline a proposal considering [the prompt](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Array_Work/blob/master/w12/ASSIGNMENT_FILES/final_project_prompt.md).
