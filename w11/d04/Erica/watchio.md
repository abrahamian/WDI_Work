# Watch.io

To tie together everything we've been learning about Backbone and integrating it with Rails, we're going to build an app to help us keep track of what movies we want to watch.

### Directions
* Work in Pairs

### Implement the following user stories
* As a user, I never want to have to refresh the page for ANYTHING. Build me a single page app please!
* As a user I want to be able to search for a movie and see search results. For each movie, I'd like to see the Movie Title, Poster, and Plot.
* As a user I want to be able to add a movie I've searched for to my watch list
* As a user I want to my watch list to persist
* As a user I want to mark a movie on my watch list as "seen"
* As a user I want to give a movie on my watch list a rating from 1 - 5
* As a user I should only be able to rate movies I've already seen
* As a user I want to be able to delete movies from my watch list
