Great old old bar, cool booths.  Also check out upstairs.

[Shorty's - Madison btwn 27th & 28th](http://www.shortysnyc.com/madison.php)
Best cheesteak in NY.  Sports galore.  Bourbon.  And also cheesesteak.

[Molly's - 3rd Ave btwn 23rd and 22nd](www.mollysshebeen.com/‎)
Great Irish bar / eatery, a little far afield, but sawdust on the floor and amazing hamburgers.  In the winter they have a fireplace you can sit right next to and enjoy your pint of Irish Red.

You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany.
