Phase 1

One line functionality
Assume that the N line is the only subway line first.
The user should be given a list of all the stops on the N line
The user should be able to enter the stop that they want to get on at
The user should be able to enter the stop that they want to get off at
The user should be told the number of stops for their trip

___________________________________________________________________________

print out list of stops for user
	create array
	loop over array and print out as it loops

ask user what stop they get on
	gets answer into variable

ask user what stop they get off
	gets answer into variable

give how many stops they have left (which would be stopOFF in index of array minus stopOn in array)
