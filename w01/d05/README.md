# Morning - Classes Review

Why Classes & Objects?
- I don't have access to private information!
- Behavior comes with the data!
- Instance variables!

Movies Example
- Class methods - All possible movie genres
- Inheritance - Scary movies

Inheritance:
  *  The total set of messages to which an object can respond to includes:
    1. those that it implements
    2. those implemented in all objects above it in the hierarchy
    3. those implemented in any module that has been added to it
    4. those implemented in all modules added to any object above it in the hierarchy

  * Use cases:
    * Need to group behavior, but don't need a class - just an organization tool
      * [Math module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Math.html)
    * Share behavior  where inheritance won't work
