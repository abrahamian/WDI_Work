#Guess the number

###Objectives:
- Practice with loops, conditionals

###Prompt:
- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

###Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.
- This should be done in a new file called guess_the_number.rb

###Note
- If you want, you can use the `guess_the_number-prompt.rb` file as a starter. Make sure that if you do, you are copying it to __your own folder__ rather than editing it directly.
