Tuesday Scrum:
Yesterday I created a basic welcome page, got user account creation working.  User account page loads.  Got login working along with user authorization and user logout.

Today I'm going to work on the admin list and then the task system.

Biggest obstacle will be completing the task system most fleshed out today.


Wednesday Scrum:
Yesterday:
 I created the admin list in the user profile, as well as the admin index and show pages.

 I created the services object.  Services list on the user profile, which links to a services index which in turn links to service show pages.  Admins can add services.

 Much more I'm not remembering

 Today:
 Today I am going to buid out the quotes object and start to interconnect the peices more, adding features to each object.

 Biggest obstacle(s):
 Getting all the pieces together.
