USER STORY
I'm a user that may have spotted Dylan the Dog somewhere on the street and taken a photo.  If I have not taken a photo of Dylan the Dog I may be interested in uploading a photo of my own pet, in a unique NYC location.  I'm interested in gaining exposure for these photos, and promoting them on social media to gain more votes for them and possibly have them featured on the website as the photo of the day.

The first time I choose to upload a photo I will be presented with a signup form where I have to enter my email, and create a username and password.  Upon creation of my profile I can upload photos, and I will remain logged in to the site until my session expires.  Upon returning to the site I can login with the information that created previously.  

SCRUM
--Yesterday: I worked on my schema and setup my users and posts table, routes, along with controllers, and forms/views for creating new user and new post.  I also setup the PaperClip gem, integrated it with my database schema, and posts form.  The image data is storing but I have not yet integrated it with Amazon S3 and need to setup my session controller to associate posts with users.

--What I'm doing today: Working on setting up session controller..authentication and autorization.  Then getting Amazon S3 linked up with PaperClip allowing me to upload images, associate them with users, and make them visible in my views.  I also need to integrate password and password_confirmation into my users table.  Lastly I would like to begin to tackle the voting mechanism, create my JOIN table that will keep track of votes with post(id) and user(id).

--What could be a potential problem: The getting images in and out of the Amazon S3 cloud and setting up my voting mechanism.
