Monday - Got my models set up, and figured out how to use the Rotten Tomatoes API/Gem. Also got user authenticiation set up, and deployed to Heroku. 

Tuesday - Today I will try and get my routes and controllers set up properly so I can complete the following user stories: 
"Search for a single movie on RT so that I can obtain information about that movie"
"Add movies to my categorized database so that I can refer back to them at a later date"

Wednesday - Yesterday I was able to access the Rotten Tomatoes API in order to search and display a movie for the user. I began working on the feature where a user can then add a movie to their database based on categories such as "liked it, didn't like it, want to see it." I am going to continue working on that today, and hopefully work on a feature where the user can then sort the movies based on different criteria. I would also like to implement a feature where the user can search a movie at random.
