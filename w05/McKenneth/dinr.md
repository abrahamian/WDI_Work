# din.r

> To dine, or to die. That's the question, din.r is the answer.

****
din.r is an app that takes alot of the guesswork out of choosing a "safe" restaurant to eat at. Using the experience of being a health inspector for NYC for three years, I made an app that puts all restaurants into 3 categories: the good, the bad and the ugly. Also, it is color coded for ease of use. Users can make can account and keep a list of favorites. Also maps are provided for all restaurants.
