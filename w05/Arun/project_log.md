Tuesday:
Yesterday, I worked on getting my API's to work.  Got it all working well.  Today, I am working on my logic and getting my API's to associate w/ each other and produce the results I want.

User story I am working on today:  "As a user, I want to compare movies in theaters to twitter sot hat I can get a good idea about what the general public is feeling towards any particular film"



Wednesday:
Yesterday, I worked on the logic of my site.  I made it half way there; I have to find/create a method that will search through each array of tweets and find key words and keep count of positive to negative words.

User story I am working on today:  "As a user, I want to compare movies in theaters to a group of twitter arrays and spit out a Flick reck score"
