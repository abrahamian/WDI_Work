>## User Stories in order of implementation:

* As a user, I want to sign in so I can have my selected senator(s) saved.

* As a user, I want to input my zipcode and see what US senator represents me because I may not know.

* As a user, I want to click on my senator and see what Disney character they are most like because I read too much Buzzfeed. 

* As a user, I want to see some legislative actions that my senator made so I can understand why they are like that Disney character. 

* As a user, I want to see some links to my senator's social media so I can contact them.

* As a user, I want to search again so I can learn about other representatives. 


>## Scrummin' It day two:

* So far I have completed: As a user, I want to input my zipcode and see what US senator represents me because I may not know. I also implemented: As a user, I want to see some links to my senator's social media so I can contact them.

* Today I need to understand my sunlight congress API (not gem) enough to extract votes on four different pieces of legislation. I then need to add these (as a four digit "key")into a votes column in my senator schema. I then need plan how to match the data that I have stored into the votes column with a disney character table. 


>## Scrummin' it day three:

* I wasn't able to create any user stories yesterday, I realised that my gem didn't give me information about how senators voted, so I had to think of a way to get around that. I ended up creating a table which contained a senator last name column and a string which containes their voting information which I copied from a .gov website and formatted for instertion. Today I need to create another table so my API workes again and join the tables so I can retrieve the voting info string when the API is called. If by the end of the day I could get my new model structure figured out and working I woud be so happy.
