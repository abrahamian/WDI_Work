ruby based on Object                              Whereas JavaScript is Functional
Orientation                                       There is One Global Object
Syntax                                            Syntax
everything is an Object                           primitive types and complex types
                                                  Arrays and Objects = Hash
                                                  The assignment operator works differently for both complex
                                                  and primitives types
                                                  Truth and false values are very different in these two
                                                  equality operators (==) (===)

Keep In Mind
End Statements with semicolon ;
Use Parenthesis with your functions!
Comments!
Doesnt Read Like English like Ruby
Functions Have No implicit return


Why JavaScript
Written for the web
implemented for the web
Frameworks -- Jquery underscore backbone
growing on the server side    MEAN Stack
Speed and robustness, tools
V8 engine
JSON
