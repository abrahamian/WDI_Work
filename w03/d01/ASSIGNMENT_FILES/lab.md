#Movies.io w/Database

* Update your Sinatra Movies App from Friday to use a SQL database instead of reading/writing to a text file.

### Workflow

* Plan your schema
* Create your DB
* Test your DB (psql)
* Refactor your code

##Bonus
* Explore the other information that you can get back from the OMDB API. (Runtime, Director, Genre, etc)

* Have your app respond to GET "/movies/recent" by displaying a page with ONLY the movies whose year is 2008 or later.

* Have your app respond to GET "/movies/good" by displaying a page with ONLY the movies whose imdb rating is 8.0 or above.

* Have your app respond to GET "/movies/funny" by displaying a page with ONLY the movies whose genre includes "Comedy".
