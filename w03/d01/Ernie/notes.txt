Databases

SQL: Postgresql
Active Record
Joins

Vocab
RDBMS = Orcale,MySql,PostgreSQL
ACID = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID

A DBMS is a server
pssql -h localhost is starting a server

Database is an organized collection of information i.e models

models describe how we want to interact with said data

Schema descirbe how that information is inputed and outputed at the most basic level the schema is a description of tables in the database.

Tables = colums describes data rows are instances of the data

first thing you do on a project is model the data which turns into a schema

the tables dont only describe the model the also describe the entity and the entity's have realationships and example of an entity is (User)

SQL = Structed/Server Query Langauge

PostgreSQL Data Types
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype.html

integers 
strings varchar(n) n= number of character that will be alloted in memory for this string

serial = creation of a unique Id (serial #)
price = money
date = date
date
boolean
arrays


databases need a unique value from which to access all data points. They usually use an id which is a uniqe key and cannot be null or NOT NULL the id is usally referred to as the primary key

SQL command should always be in capital and end with semicolon

The way you always interact with POSTGRESQL is with text String request between the client and the server

using defaults for your attributes 

SQL COMMANDS
CREATE DATABASE name;
DROP DATABASE name; -remove
DROP TABLE (table_name);
INSERT INTO Table Name (colums) VALUES (DATA);
SELECT * FROM table name

INSERT = CREATE in HTTP = POST
SELECT = READING in HTTP = GET
          UPDATE in HTTP = PUT
          DELETE in HTTP = DELETE

PSQL COMMAND
\c (DATABASE NAME)- connect to database changes the user and its a psql command
\d Tbname


PSQL is a program that runs on the command line like pry

if it starts with a \ the command line assumes its psql
