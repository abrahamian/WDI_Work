# MOMA App

This app will have 2 models: Artists and Paintings. An Artist has many paintings, and a Painting belongs to an Artist.

An Artist has
* name
* nationality
* date of birth

A Painting has
* title
* year
* image_urla

###First!
<!-- Create a directory called `moma_app` to hold all of your files. -->

###Part 1 - Database Schemas

<!-- Create a new database called `moma_db`. Create the database table schemas to model Artists, Paintings, and their relationships. Save these to a file called `moma.sql` -->

###Part 2 - Setting up ActiveRecord

<!-- Create a Ruby program (like we did with clown cars) that creates an ActiveRecord interface for interacting with the artists & paintings. Save this to a file called `moma.rb` -->

<!-- Populate your database (using ActiveRecord) with at least 3 Artists and 2 Paintings per artist (associated correctly!), including Vincent Van Gogh and Pablo Picasso. -->

###Part 3 - ActiveRecord Practice
<!--
Write the commands that you would enter in pry to do the following:
Save the pry commands to a file called `ar_commands.txt`

1. Create a new Artist (Vincent Van Gogh) and save him to your database
2. Create a new Painting (Starry Night) and save it to your database

3. Return all Artists
4. Return all Paintings

5. Return the artist with an id of 2
6. Return the artist with a name of "Vincent Van Gogh"
7. Return all the artists from "Spain"

8. Return the painting with an id of 1
9. Return the painting with a name of "Guernica"
10. Return the image url for the painting with title "Starry Night"

11. Return all the paintings that "Pablo Picasso" painted
12. Return the image urls for all the paintings that "Pablo Picasso" painted in an array
13. Return the artist of "Guernica"

14. Change Vincent Van Gogh's nationality to USA
15. Change "Starry Night" to be one of Pablo Picasso's paintings -->
