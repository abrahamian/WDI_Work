#Week 3: Sinatra MVC

###What did we do last week?

We talked about the web and how HTTP requests and responses send data back and forth. We built our first Sinatra apps to serve HTML and CSS, respond to links, and submit the form data. We started talking about the idea of persistence using File I/O.
