DATABASES
Database server (DBMS/RDBMS)
Postgres

DB itself is one of many accessible thru DBMS

clients that interface with postgres (PSQL & PG)

PSQL is a command line tool

While PG is a ruby gem

Data modeling and DB arch

Schema
entities = tables
attributes = coloums
demons = data
realations/mutilple tables

SQL the language 
CREATE/DROP tables
INSERT new data (create) POST
SELECT data (read) GET
UPDATE table SET number_of_item (update) PUT
DELETE  (delete) Delete
Active Record - ORM object relation mapper = ruby framework
coventions withn active_record


SELECT (arrtibutes); for one table

to do more than one selection from one table you add a CLAUSE like (FROM)

i.e SELECT * FROM

clauses = INTO, VALUES, FROM, WHERE,IN,Order by,LIMIT #,GROUPBY

WHERE clauses evalute to true or false using computer operators = < > <= >= !=
you can also chain them together with boolean operator such as AND,OR but no (&&,||)
LIMIT goes by in order of insertion

GROUPBY = its a function that queries the attributes and removes all duplica
tes and returns all unique values
As = as always follows an attribute and renames it a new name before (Attribute AS Attribute)

SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE store IN ('sears','macy''s','Toys R us'); 
SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE store IN ('Borders','JC Penny''s','macy''s') ORDERBY price (DESC);
SELECT * FROM receipts LIMIT 5; 
SELECT * FROM receipts GROUP BY store;
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM receipts;
SELECT COUNT (item) FROM receipts WHERE store = 'JC Penny''s';
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM receipts WHERE store = 'JC Penny''s';
SELECT SUM(number_ofitem) FROM receipts WHERE store = 'JC Penny''s';


Aggregrate Functions
SUM = adds 
COUNT = counts elements or instance but does not them
AVG()

IF your in a SET clause it equals assignment

ALTER = the ablity to alter the schema 

Normalizing - to take all data for a project and break it up into entities that have attributes and relationships between those entities in terms of zero, one or many.

1:1 relationships
1:many relationships
many:many relationships = although this makes sense logically you do don't want this in terms of a database its much more efficent to add another table with a join
