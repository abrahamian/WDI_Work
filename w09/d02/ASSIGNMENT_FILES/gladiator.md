# Rspec Gladiator Arena

Work in pairs

* An arena has a name (I called mine "The Coliseum")
* You can add a gladiator to the arena
* A gladiator has a name and a weapon
* The arena can support up to 20 unique gladiators, but no more
* You can see if a certain gladiator is in the arena
* You can pick any two gladiators in the arena fight to the death.
* Winning conditions:
  * If Maximus is in the fight, he should win.
  * Trident beats short sword
  * Short sword beats club
  * Club beats trident
* You can check to see if the crowd is entertained
* The crowd is only entertained if Maximus was in the last fight
* When a fight is over, the user should be prompted to put their thumbs up or down. If they vote down, remove the losing gladiator from the arena (ie they die)
