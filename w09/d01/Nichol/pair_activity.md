Elevators, Floors, and (probably) a Dispatcher
- 10 floors
- A floor can call an elevator to go up or down
- The top floor can only call for down
- The bottom floor can only call for up
- An elevator is either heading up or down
- People can call specific floors within the elevator
- if an elevator is heading up, it only stops at floors either called internally or on floors calling in the direction the elevator is going (on the way)
  - example, the elevator is on floor two heading up. internally floors 4 and 6 are pressed. Floor 8 has requested down and Floor 9 has requested up. We hit 4, 6, and 9. And then we head down hitting floor 8.
- If there are no requests for the elevator, then it is neither heading up nor down. It will go to the next floor that calls it in either direction.

**UPDATE**

Forget about the floors calling for the elevator.
The elevator can only be called internally. It still heads in just 1 direction, and ignores calls to floors not on it's way. But start first with just the internal calls
